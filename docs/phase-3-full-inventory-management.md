# Epic: Full Inventory Management (CRUD)

**Phase**: 3
**Parent**: [Product Roadmap](../ROADMAP.md)

## Objective

Enhance the inventory management dashboard to support full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This will allow authorized users to manage the entire product lifecycle from within the application.

## Key Deliverables

- **(P2)** As an inventory manager, I want to be able to update the stock count for a product through the dashboard.
- **(P2)** As an inventory manager, I want to receive an email alert when a product's stock level drops below 10 units.
