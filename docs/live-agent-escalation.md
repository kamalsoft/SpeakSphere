# Epic: Live Agent Escalation

**Epic ID**: E07
**Phase**: 4
**Parent**: [Product Roadmap](../ROADMAP.md)

## Objective

Enable a seamless transfer from the AI voice agent to a human agent when requested by the user or when the AI cannot handle the query. This involves integrating with a Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) platform to manage call routing and agent queues.

## Key Deliverables

- As a user, I want to say "talk to an agent" to be transferred to a real person.
- As a developer, I need to integrate with a CCaaS platform to manage call queues and agent status.
