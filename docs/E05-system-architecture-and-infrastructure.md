# Epic: System Architecture & Infrastructure

**Phase**: Ongoing
**Parent**: [Product Roadmap](../ROADMAP.md)

## Objective

Establish and maintain a scalable, secure, and modular backend infrastructure. This includes setting up core services, implementing robust security measures, and ensuring the architecture can support future growth.

## Key Deliverables

- **(P0)** As a developer, I need the core backend infrastructure (API Gateway, Chat Service, MongoDB) set up to support MVP functionality.
- **(P1)** As a developer, I need to implement a robust user authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) system for the internal dashboard.
- **(P2)** As a security engineer, I need to harden the system's data handling and access controls to meet HIPAA compliance standards.
